# 🌸 Cute Pi Alarm Clock

An adorable kawaii-style alarm clock that requires you to prove you're awake by entering digits of π.

## Features

- 🎀 **Kawaii Design** - Pink and mint gradient with cute decorations
- ⏰ **Interactive Clock** - Drag the hour and minute hands to set your alarm
- 🔢 **π Challenge** - Enter the first N digits of pi to stop the alarm (based on alarm time)
- 🔊 **Cute Sound Effects** - Cartoonish "boing" sounds when rotating dials
- 📱 **Touch Friendly** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- 🎵 **Escalating Alarm** - Gets progressively louder every 10 seconds

## How It Works

Set your alarm by clicking "Set Alarm" and dragging the clock hands. When the alarm triggers, you must enter the first `N` digits of π (where N = HHMM of your alarm time) to stop it.

For example, if you set the alarm for 07:15, you need to enter `715` digits of π: `3.14159265358979323846...`
